F ðŸŒž C the Weather is a simple web app I created to help see
the weather in both Fahrenheit and Celsius at the same time. 
As an Australian living in the United States I still haven't
managed to switch between the two but find it helpful to see
both temperatures side by side so I can chat with friends 
easily. I was particularly inspired to create this app during
a Los Angeles heatwave as we all know the only topic of conversation
during a heatwave is the temperature. 

The app is built with Javascript, using the National Weather Service (NWS) API to access up to 5 days of weather, showing users the max and min temperatures forecast. I kept the design simple, just providing the key information needed, but added a few emojis that dynamically match the weather description for a fun user experience. I have added the app as a widget to my iPhone for easy access but would love to build it into an actual iPhone app one day as my programming skills expand.
